# rivine-wd

A daemon which brings Rivine to the web using WebAssembly,
using [rivine-rs (the Rivine protocol implemented in Rust)](https://github.com/rivine/rivine-rs) compiled down to WebAssembly,
using this as the core logic, with a frontend dashboard on top of it.

It gives you the advantage that you can run a full Rivine client,
directly from your browser, without having to install anything,
and always running the latest version.
